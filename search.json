    "text": "Results\nBathymetric data from 156 lakes were digitised and collated for use in this study.\nUsing a machine learning model, we were able to predict maximum lake depth from morphometric data with an \\(r^2\\) = 0.8 and mean lake depth with an \\(r^2\\) = 0.6.\nThis was substantially better than the FENZ dataset, which had an \\(r^2\\) = 0.4 for max depth and 0.2 for mean depth."
