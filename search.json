    "text": "Motivation\n\nDeveloping the Lake Ecosystem Research New Zealand modelling platfom (LERNZmp). \nLake depth and morphometry are key drivers of lake ecosystem function, therefore accurate depth data is essential (Ganz, Glines, and Rose 2024).\nThe Freshwater Ecosystems New Zealand (FENZ) database is the most comprehensive database of lake morphometry in New Zealand, but is limited in its depth data.\nNZ lakes provide a unique opportunity to develop a comprehensive database of lake depth and morphometry, particularly given the diversity of lake size, depth and geomorphic type."
